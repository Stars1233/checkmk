Code for processing Checkmk werks. This is needed by several components,
so it's best place is in the central library.

We are currently in the progress of moving the werk files from nowiki syntax to
markdown. The files written by the developers (in `.werks` folder in this repo)
contain markdown if the filenames ends with `.md`, otherwise nowiki syntax.

In order to speed up the loading of the werk files they are precompiled and
packaged as json during release. Pydantic model Werk is used to handle the
serializing and deserializing.

But all this should be implementation details, because downstream tools should
only handle the WerkV2 model. Old style werks are converted to markdown Werks,
so both can be handled with a common interface.
