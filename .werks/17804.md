This Werk is only applicable for plugin developers.
It fixes the usage of `Topic.Virtualization` in the ruleset API `cmk.rulesets.v1`.
Previously, when trying to set `topic=Topic.Virtualization`, it would silently break the indexing for the quicksearch function.
Additionally crashes would be logged to the crash reports.

Now everything works as expected.
