See werk 18032 for basic information.

The transformation of all inventory trees of all hosts may take very long in large environments.
Thus it cannot be done during `cmk-update-config` and we have to choose another way. There are two
mechanisms in place:

 * a cronjob runs once per day at midnight and transforms a bundle of inventory trees one by one

 * you may use the transformation command `cmk-transform-inventory-files` on your own in order to
   execute the transformation manually, eg. for specific hosts.

If you are interested in the results then run `cmk-transform-inventory-trees --show-results`. This
might be helpful in order to get a feel for some statistics like the duration of these
transformations.
