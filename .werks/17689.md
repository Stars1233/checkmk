With this werk, the agent plugin **rds_licenses.vbs** is ported to **rds_licenses.ps1**
in version **2.5**.

The behavior, output formats, and results in the GUI remain unchanged:

- No rule reconfiguration is needed.
- To start using the new plugin, bake the agent and update it on the host machine.
- If you use manual agent installations, make sure to replace **rds_licenses.vbs**
  with the **rds_licenses.ps1** in the `ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins` directory.

**Additional information for users:**

- The **rds_licenses.ps1** requires Windows PowerShell (version 5.0 and above) on the
  target system.
- Ensure that any custom modifications to **rds_licenses.vbs** are ported to the new
  script if needed.
- Review your agent update policies to ensure a smooth transition.
- No changes are required on the Checkmk server side; only the agent on the monitored
  Windows hosts needs updating.
