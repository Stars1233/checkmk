This changes the interface of the `mkp template NAME` command.
The created manifest template is now written to stdout instead of `tmp/check_mk/NAME.manifest.temp`.
Users now have to pipe the output into whichever file they see fit.
The synopsis of the command remains unchanged.
So, to get the same behavior as before, you'd run:

```
mkp template NAME > tmp/check_mk/NAME.manifest.tmp
```
