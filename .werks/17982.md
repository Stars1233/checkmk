As of this change, Checkmk will now restrict the maximum file upload size to 100MB. This change
will affect but may not be limited to:

* Adding new icons.
* Uploading CRT/PEM files.
* Bulk host addition via CSV spreadsheets.
* Uploading MKP packages.
* Importing a calendar with ICS files.

This restriction has been performed to better improve the site's resilience to upload based attacks.
