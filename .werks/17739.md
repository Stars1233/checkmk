This Werk extends the option 'Host name used for containers' of agent rule 'Docker node and containers'.
The value 'Combine the nodename and the name of the container' can be used to customize the name of a piggyback host.
This configuration will prefix the container name with the nodename (as reported by the device via `uname -n`).
