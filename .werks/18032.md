So far the inventory trees are saved with Python's `repr` function and loaded with
`ast.literal_eval`. Now new or archived trees are saved as `json`.

A distributed setup may be constituted of sites where remote sites use already this version and
the central site still uses a 2.4.0 version. In order to make the `repr` vs. `json` inventory
tree transformation work the central site must be at least of version 2.4.0p3. See also werk 18034.

A simple test shows a clear performance improvement. Loading 150 trees, each of size 1.7 MB, takes

  * 65 seconds with `ast.literal_eval`

  * 2 seconds with `json.loads`
