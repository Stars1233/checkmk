The graph editor interface has been redesigned to improve usability and workflow efficiency. Key
improvements include:

 * `Constants` can now be modified after creation, similar to metrics and scalars, providing more flexibility during graph configuration.

 * The `Line` configuration has been split into separate `Line style` and `Mirrored` options for clearer control over graph appearance.

 * `Operations` and `transformations` are now grouped in a dedicated section, making the interface more organized and easier to navigate.

 * Custom titles can now be configured for graph elements, allowing for better customization of graph displays.

 * Button labels have been streamlined throughout the interface. For example, `Add new metric` is now simply `Add`.

 * The `Metrics with all zero values` option has been converted from a checkbox to a dropdown menu and renamed to `Graph metrics with all zero values` for better clarity.

 * A confirmation dialog now appears when attempting to leave the editor with unsaved changes, preventing accidental data loss.

These changes make the graph editor more intuitive and reduce the risk of losing work due to unsaved modifications.
