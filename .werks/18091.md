The ruleset for configuring the Elasticsearch query active check has been updated to support additional configuration:

- Added configuration option to disable TLS certificate verification when querying the service.
- Added configuration option to return a WARN or CRIT status if the number of messages returned by the Elasticsearch instance falls below a defined threshold.
