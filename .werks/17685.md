With this werk, the agent plugin **mk_inventory.vbs** is ported to **mk_inventory.ps1**
in version **2.5**.

The behavior, output formats, and results in the GUI remain unchanged, except for a
small improvement:

- For Windows 10 and above, the **Operating System** section now shows the Kernel
  version including the Windows Update Build Revision (UBR) number.
- For lower Windows versions, the Kernel version format remains the same.

**Important information:**

After the Checkmk update, the **mk_inventory.vbs** will no longer send inventory data.

Steps to stay compliant:

- If the **HW/SW Inventory (Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX)** rule set has already been
  configured, no reconfiguration is needed.
- To continue receiving inventory data, you must bake the agent and update it on the
  host machine.
- If you use manual agent installations, make sure to replace **mk_inventory.vbs**
  with the **mk_inventory.ps1** in the `ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins` directory.

Please be aware that the mk_inventory script (the old vbs and the new ps1) can take
some time to execute.
To avoid problems with partial delivery of data, we recommend configuring the following
settings in **Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules**:

- **Set execution mode for plug-ins and local checks:** Asynchronous
- **Set cache age for plug-ins and local checks:** 14400 seconds
- **Set timeouts for plug-ins and local checks:** 600 seconds

**Additional information for users:**

- The **mk_inventory.ps1** requires Windows PowerShell (version 5.0 and above) on the
  target system.
- Ensure that any custom modifications to **mk_inventory.vbs** are ported to the new
  script if needed.
- Review your agent update policies to ensure a smooth transition.
- No changes are required on the Checkmk server side; only the agent on the monitored
  Windows hosts needs updating.
