This werk adds a new check plug-in that monitors the residual operating current of PDUs.
It provides information about the residual operating current of a PDU and alerts if the current exceeds configured thresholds.
Threshold levels for the new check plug-in can be defined by configuring the _"Residual current parameters for PDUs"_ rule.
