This new endpoint is considered as `unstable` and might change in the future. It is available at
`http[s]://<CHECKMK_SERVER>/<SITE>/check_mk/api/unstable/domain-types/inventory/collections/all`.

See the following code template with Python's `requests`. The variable `HOST_NAMES` contains the
host names for which inventory trees are fetched.

```python
import pprint
import requests

HOST_NAME = "checkmk_server"
SITE_NAME = "hostname"
PROTO = "http"  # [http|https]
API_URL = f"{PROTO}://{HOST_NAME}/{SITE_NAME}/check_mk/api/unstable"

USERNAME = "automation"
PASSWORD = "..."

HOST_NAMES = ["hostname"]

session = requests.session()
session.headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {USERNAME} {PASSWORD}"
session.headers["Accept"] = "application/json"

resp = session.get(
    f"{API_URL}/domain-types/inventory/collections/all",
    params={"host_names": HOST_NAMES},
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
)

if resp.status_code == 200:
    pprint.pprint(resp.json())
else:
    raise RuntimeError(pprint.pformat(resp.json()))
```

As soon as it's stable you'll find the documentation in the REST-API documentation below
`Monitoring > HW/SW Inventory`.

The HW/SW Inventory data contains static data of a host, eg. serial numbers of disks, which can
be used for further processing, eg. add entries to CMDBs.

Please have a look at the related [HW/SW Inventory documentation][docs].
