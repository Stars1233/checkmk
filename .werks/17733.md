With this change, the new SMART services use the model together with the serial number as an item.
The following plugins are affected:

* `smart_ata_temp`
* `smart_ata_stats`
* `smart_nvme_temp`
* `smart_nvme_stats`
* `smart_scsi_temp`

These plug-ins require the `smart_posix` plug-in to be deployed.
