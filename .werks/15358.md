In larger organisations a user may not always have access to the
cmk-update-agent.state file. This makes it hard to detect a mismatch between
the registered hostname and the actual hostname in checkmk.

Now the registered host name is shown along other agent information in the
"Check_MK Agent" service.

When the configured host name for the agent updater and the host name in Checkmk
do not match, the service will show both and go to CRIT.
